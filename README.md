# Blog_platform Readme 
This is the blog-platform which was created as my first project on that framework. I have used SQlite3 as db, Django ORM, class-based-views as controllers and little bootstrap 5.
## Install 
This project uses [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
```sh
$ pip install django
$ pip install djangorestframework
```
